import math

# Get the radius from the user
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the area
area = math.pi * radius**2

# Print the area
print("The area of the circle is:", area)
Please help me write a simple Python calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
